		<p><em>I have 4 years professional experience</em> doing digital product design. In that time, I've been involved in every part of the process &mdash; defining product goals and strategy, solving user and business problems, building comprehensive design systems, growing teams, working with engineers, building interactive prototypes, extensive user testing, and even pushing code. I believe the best products involve design from the very beginning, and strive to build experiences that are are as enjoyable as they are valuable. </p>
